# Scientific Calculator

## Overview
This is a **scientific calculator** built using C++ and `wxWidgets`. The application provides an interactive GUI with dynamically created buttons using a **Button Factory**, allowing for a flexible and scalable design.

---

## Features
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** built with `wxWidgets`.
- **Dynamic Button Factory** to generate calculator buttons programmatically.
- Supports **basic arithmetic** operations (+, -, *, /, %).
- Implements **scientific functions** such as trigonometry, logarithms, and exponentiation.
- **Error handling** for invalid inputs and edge cases.
- Designed using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles**.

## **Setup Instructions**
Once **wxWidgets is installed and built**, follow these steps:

1. **Fork the Repository**:  
   - Click the **"Fork"** button in the top-right corner of the repository page.

2. **Clone Your Fork**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/scientific_calculator.git
   cd scientific_calculator
   ```
3. Open the Project in Visual Studio:
   Open Scientific_Calculator.sln.

4. Configure Project Settings:

   Navigate to Project Properties
   
   C/C++ â†’ General â†’ Additional Include Directories:
   ```bash
   C:\wxWidgets\include;C:\wxWidgets\include\msvc
   ```
   C/C++ â†’ All Options â†’ Additional Include Directories:
   ```bash

   ```

   Linker â†’ System:
   Ensure **Subsystem** is set to **Windows (/SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS)**.

6. Ensure the Build Configuration is Set Correctly:
   Select Win32 Debug mode before building.

7. Build & Run

## **Troubleshooting**
If the application does not compile, check the following:
   - Ensure wxWidgets is installed and built correctly.
   - Double-check project include paths and linker settings.
   - Ensure the app is running in Win32 Debug mode.
   - Try restarting Visual Studio if build issues persist.
